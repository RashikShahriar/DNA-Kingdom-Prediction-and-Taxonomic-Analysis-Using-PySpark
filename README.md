# DNA-Kingdom-Prediction-and-Taxonomic-Analysis-Using-PySpark
The project aims to analyze DNA codon usage patterns across different species using a large DNA sequence dataset. The primary focus is to investigate how codon frequencies correlate with various taxonomic classifications, potentially uncovering evolutionary trends and taxonomic signatures.

## Objectives

DNA Kingdom Prediction:

#Predict the taxonomic kingdom of DNA sequences based on codon usage patterns.
- Machine learning models classify DNA sequences into taxonomic categories, focusing on the kingdom level (e.g., Orthornavirae, Trapavirae).
- Evaluate model performance, employing metrics such as accuracy and F1-score to ensure classification effectiveness.
- Taxonomic Analysis through Codon Usage Patterns:

#Large-Scale Data Processing with PySpark:
- Efficiently load, clean, and preprocess large genomic datasets using PySpark, showcasing its suitability for big data in bioinformatics.
- Conduct data summarization, missing value handling, and feature engineering within the PySpark environment to prepare data for analysis and machine learning.
- Processing a dataset with potentially millions of sequences demonstrates PySpark's scalability, enabling rapid insights and visualizations of codon usage patterns.
